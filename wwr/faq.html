            <p class="p1">Q: How long is a rafting session?<br><br>A: A typical rafting session lasts between 2 to 3 hours, although the exact duration can vary depending on factors like the river's flow, the type of rapids, and the specific route you choose. Some trips may be shorter if you're opting for a more relaxed, scenic float, while more intense, adventure-packed trips could take a bit longer.</p>

            <p class="p2">Q: What is the minimum age?<br><br>A:Our rafting trips are designed to be family-friendly, offering a fun and safe experience for adventurers of all ages. However, to ensure the safety and enjoyment of everyone on the water, the minimum age required to participate in our trips is 8 years old. This age limit is in place to ensure that children are physically capable of handling the raft and the river's conditions, as well as following the safety guidelines set by our experienced guides. </p>

            <p class="p5">Q: Do I need to know how to swim for this trip?<br><br>A: While our rafting trips offer plenty of opportunities to swim, knowing how to swim is not a requirement to enjoy the experience. Safety is our top priority, and we provide lifejackets for all participants, which must be worn throughout the trip. These lifejackets are designed to keep you buoyant in the water, allowing you to float safely even if you end up in the river. Our experienced guides will also go over important safety instructions before you begin, including how to handle situations if you fall into the water. If you're not comfortable swimming or if you're a beginner, you can still have a fantastic time. </p>
