      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The puropse of this site is to intrigue the people on
        the site and persuade them to inquire me to book them as clients.
        A key aspect of this is a simple and visually stunning page that showcases
        my abilities a a videographer, and incites a desire to know more about how
        to get me to shhot their wedding or weddings. I want to make it as easy as possible
        for prospective clients to reach out to me and inquire.
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience will consist of brides and grooms to be, relatives of engaged people, and 
        wedding planners looking to book for their clients. Brides and grooms will be very
        interested in seeing adaptability or a diverse collection of portfolio. Relatives 
        may have a slightly lower standard, and will likely be looking for prices. Wedding planners 
        will be looking for quality portfolio to showcase their own businesses, and also to see
        if I can become an ongoing help to them for their future gigs.
