        <h2>Drew Stanley</h2>
        <p>My name is Drew Stanley, and I'm very happy to be in this class
            for the semester. My major is Sofware Enfineering, and coding is 
            honestly a great hobby of mine. I alos love reading all sorts of books,
            and love playing guitar. I'm saving up for an electric right now. I think
            taht web design is so cool, and would love to learn the skills so that
            I can make a good webpage for my video business. My favorite scripture is 
            Isaiah 53 because whenever I think about it, I have more reverence for the
            Savior and His sacrifice for us.
